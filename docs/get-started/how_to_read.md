# How to read this documentation site
This documentation site is designed to assist users in their understanding of the Tao ecosystem.

* For voters: Voters who mainly vote for masternodes to receive rewards are 
encouraged to read our tutorials on [how to connect wallets to Tao](/get-started/wallet) and [how to vote](/get-started/voting/).

* For masternode owners: A masternode is an important entity in Tao's ecosystem.
A Tao masternode is a server which uses its computing power to 
contribute to the network. Its job is to create and sign blocks. 
For this contribution to the network, masternodes receive rewards in 
the form of TAO.
A masternode must satisfy the [minimum requirements](/masternode/masternode-setup-guide/#technical-requirements-recommendations) regarding computing power, RAM, and storage in order to stably maintain the network.
A financial requirement of 50k TAO is also needed to [apply](/masternode/masternode-setup-guide/#11-apply-for-masternode-candidacy) 
to become a masternode candidate.
For this, masternode owners should carefully read our dedicated guide to [running a masternode](/masternode/masternode-setup-guide), 
using [taomn](/masternode/masternode-setup-guide/#6-installing-taomn-utility) and [Docker](/masternode/masternode-setup-guide/#5-setup-docker-logged-in-as-new-user).
Also, masternode owners can follow our [tutorial](https://medium.com/taoblockchain/how-to-run-a-tao-masternode-from-a-to-z-3793752dc3d1) on the Tao medium page 
and our [wiki page](https://github.com/taoblockchain/docs/wiki).


* For developers: We highly encourage developers to contribute to the development of Taoâ€™s ecosystem growth.
For this reason, we have been building a set of developer tutorials and documentation 
on developing DApps to be run on Tao as well as to contribute to the development
of Tao's products.
This [DApp tutorial](https://taoblockchain.github.io/docs/developers/dappdeploytuto/) shows how to deploy a smart contract 
on Tao.
For developers who are curious about Tao's source code, this 
[private Tao testnet](https://taoblockchain.github.io/docs/get-started/run-node/) guides you how to setup 
a private Tao testnet.
